HS Ping is an API service that enables country-specific HS Code search via REST API endpoints.

<Info>
  For our country coverage, see [Supported Countries](/supported-countries).
</Info>

With HS Ping, you can add instant HS code search into your software and workflow. All searches via the HS Ping API is performed within HS Ping's own dataset, sourced from official sources.

You can read more about our [data sources here](https://hsping.com/data-source).

<Note>
  HS Ping is NOT a classification service, and does not handle any product classification.

  We recommend talking to a licensed broker if you need help with classification.

## How it works

To search for HS Code references, you just need to send an API request together with the search term (query). HS Ping would return a JSON-formatted HTTP response that contain HS code references with matching query.

Additional parameters are available to refine your search results.

## Base API URL

The base API url is <kbd>https://api.hsping.com/api/v1</kbd> .

HS Ping's API supports single and bulk HS code search.
