title: "HS Code Lookup Overview"
---

HS Ping's HS Code lookup endpoint lets you search for HS / HTS code records using plain-language product descriptions.

You can search by product description, keyword, or existing HS code; and the API returns the most relevant matches for the country you specify. To keep results precise, HS Ping supports flexible text input, natural language processing, and a set of search operators for more targeted queries.

## Natural Language Processing

HS Ping's lookup engine is designed to handle real-world input without requiring exact matches. By default it:

- **Tolerates minor spelling errors**: "aluminiun foil" will still match aluminum foil
- **Handles plural and singular forms**: "toys" and "toy" return the same results
- **Ignores stop words**: common words like "for", "the", and "used in" are filtered out so they don't affect relevance

This processing happens automatically on every query, without additional parameters needed.

## Advanced Search Operators

For more precise or filtered lookups, HS Ping supports the following operators in your text query:

| Search operator | Description                                   | Example           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| " "             | Record matching an exact phrase in this order | "Plastic toy car" |
| OR              | Records that include **either** X **or** Y    | toy OR model      |
| -               | Records that **exclude** a word or phrase     | toy car -plastic  |

Operators can be combined in a single query. 

For example, <kbd>"toy car" OR "model car" -plastic</kbd> will return results matching either phrase ("toy car" or "model car") while excluding any records that mention "plastic".
