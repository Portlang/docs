title: "HS Code Lookup Overview"
---

The HS Code Lookup API accepts both plain text and numeric input; and returns related HS / HTS codes records.

It is designed to handle how people actually describe and search for products, not just plain keyword matching. Our goal is to make HS Ping the API that powers keyword search, filtering and classification workflow unique to your app.

## Natural Language Processing

HS Ping's lookup engine is designed to handle real-world input without requiring exact matches. By default it:

- **Tolerates minor spelling errors**: "aluminiun foil" will still match aluminium foil
- **Handles plural and singular forms**: "toys" and "toy" return the same results
- **Ignores stop words**: common words like "for", "the", and "used in" are filtered out so they don't affect relevance

This processing happens automatically on every query, without additional parameters needed.

## Advanced Search Operators

For more precise or filtered lookups, HS Ping supports the following operators in your text query:

| Search operator | Description                                   | Example           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| " "             | Record matching an exact phrase in this order | "Plastic toy car" |
| OR              | Records that include **either** X **or** Y    | toy OR model      |
| -               | Records that **exclude** a word or phrase     | toy car -plastic  |

Operators can be combined in a single query.

For example, <kbd>"toy car" OR "model car" -plastic</kbd> will return results matching either phrase ("toy car" or "model car") while excluding any records that mention "plastic".
