HS Ping is an API service that enables country-specific HS Code search via REST API endpoints.

<Info>
  For our country coverage, see [Supported Countries](/supported-countries).
</Info>

With HS Ping, you can add instant HS code search into your software and workflow. All searches via the HS Ping API is performed within HS Ping's own dataset, sourced from official sources.

You can read more about our [data sources here](https://hsping.com/data-source).

<Note>
  HS Ping is NOT a classification service, and does not handle any product classification.

  We recommend talking to a licensed broker if you need help with classification.

## How it works

To search for HS Code references, send an API request with your search term (query). HS Ping returns a JSON-formatted response containing HS code references matching your query.

You can use additional parameters to get more refined search results.

## Base API URL

All API requests should be made to:

 <kbd>https://api.hsping.com/api/v1</kbd> .

Current version: v1

## Search Options

HS Ping's API supports two types of searches:

- **Single HS Code Lookup** - Search for one HS code at a time
- **Batch Lookup** - Search for multiple HS codes in one request
