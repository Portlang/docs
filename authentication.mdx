All requests to HS Ping requires an active API Key.

You can create an API key through the HS Ping Dashboard → API Keys.

## Using Your API Key

To initiate a request, an active API Key must be included in the HTTP request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```
curl -X GET "https://api.hsping.com/api/v1/find?query=laptop" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY"
```

### Authentication Errors

If your API key is missing or invalid, you'll receive an <kbd>UNAUTHENTICATED</kbd> response:

```
{
"code": "UNAUTHENTICATED",
"message": "Missing Authoritzation bearer token.",
}
```
